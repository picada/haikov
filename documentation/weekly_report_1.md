# Week 1

## What did I do this week?

This week was mainly about going through the course instructions and requirements, selecting the subject and doing some initial research on Markov Chains and tier data structure. From the list of subject examples computational creativity and Markov Chains seemed most interesting, and implementing these into a haiku generator seemed like an interesting, yet still doable challenge.

## How has the program progressed?

It has not, if creating the repo does not count.

## What did I learn this week?

Some basics on computational creativity, Markov Chains and the trie data structure

## Was there something that felt difficult, or that was left unclear?

Unfortunately didn't have as much time as I had hoped this week to really dig deep into research and think about the requirements and possible limitations, but hoping that next week will be better. I have an initial idea how to start building the logic, but there are still some question marks for example how to exactly build / use the trie and what is the exact data that should to be stored. Also still maybe a bit unclear, how much it's allowed to use different ready-made solutions (for example for string processing) and data structures to support the core logic.

## What's next

More research on Markov Chains and how to use the tier data structure, start building the project. Also it's been a while since I've last done anything with Python, so probably need to refresh my memory there as well

## Time spent on the project during this week

Approximately 5 hours in total
