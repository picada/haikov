# Week 5

## What did I do this week?

Mainly focused on adding the handmade weighted random and some minor cleanups/imrovements. Also peer reviewed the assigned project.

## How has the program progressed?

The user is now able to change the Markov order, and there are a couple of more input file options. The program is also now using the self-implemented weighted random instead of `random.choices`

## Was there something that felt difficult, or that was left unclear?

Nothing difficult. A bit unclear, is some kind of performance testing needed in this kind of project? Just wondering, what I could still be missing in addition to the final cleanups and finishing the documentation.

## What's next?

Some final cleanup and reorganizing, including the error handling. The implementation document and test documentation are still WIP, so focusing on those as well. Also if there's time, thinking about implementing one additional feature, so that
the user could insert a keyword/theme based on which the poem would be generated.

## Time spent on the project during this week

Approximately 10 hours in total this week
