# Week 6

## What did I do this week?

In addition to the second peer review did some structure and code style / documentation fixes. Also started adding formatting fixes (basically capitalization) for proper nouns and tested around with adding the possibility to have the theme as input, but these are not yet pushed to the repo since not yet sure if I have time to finish these improvements.

Also did some performance testing with different inputs and settings, but didn't yet have time to write up the results.

## How has the program progressed?

No changes in the program functionality.

## What's next?

More cleaning, finishing up the testing and documentation. Maybe some formatting improvements as well, also maybe adding the keyword/input selection from input. Attending the demo on Wednesday.

## Time spent on the project during this week

Approximately 6-7 hours in total this week
