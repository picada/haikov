# Week 4

## What did I do this week?

This week was again pretty challenging schedule-wise, so not much done this week. Mainly small fixes such as formatting
the final haiku and adding input selection. Unfortunately didn't have anyt time to focus on the documentation.

## How has the program progressed?

Added formatting for the generated haiku and input selection in the UI

## Was there something that felt difficult, or that was left unclear?

Time management issues, nothing else

## What's next?

Didn't get as much done this week as I had hoped for, will catch up next week. Still have to implement the random function for
generating the next word, also error handling needs refinement. Will also focus on documentation next week. Might be that I'll give up on the graphical UI and just keep it as text based, at least not
prioritising it for now.

Some reorganizing is maybe needed as well, also going to add more options to the input files

## Time spent on the project during this week

Approximately 5 hours in total this week
