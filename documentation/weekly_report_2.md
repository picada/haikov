# Week 2

## What did I do this week?

This week wasn't unfortunately that good programming-wise, because of sudden schedule changes. However, I managed to specify the scope of the program and create a more specific plan for the logic and structure - results are not yet visible in the repo though. I also did some more reading on Trie and Markov Chains, and went through various impelentation examples on both. Also did some general catching up regarding Python.

## How has the program progressed?

This week pretty much only the basic project setup (poetry, basic dependencies such as pytest and pylint etc.) and the initial ui and logic for reading the input file.

## Was there something that felt difficult, or that was left unclear?

Not really much in addition to the time related challenges. There were some question marks about the topic, mainly if it's possible to have enough training data to have any meaningful results, but based on discussions it seems that it should be doable - if not, the topic can be altered a bit during the process.

## What's next?

Really start building the logic, next I should probably focus on creating the trie structure and the logic for preprocessing the input text to a form where it's savable to the trie.

## Time spent on the project during this week

Approximately 8 hours in total
